# Segmenting-and-Clustering-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto

In this project,we will explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. 
For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster 
the neighborhoods in Toronto. We scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, 
clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.
We then explore the data, fetch near by venues and cluster the data based on that. 
Example venues examples are parks, airports, restaurants etc.
